# Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on data collected from direct marketing campaigns. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of subscription. This prediction can help the bank optimize its marketing strategy and improve targeting efforts for future campaigns.

## ðŸ“Š About the Data

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-the-success-of-bank-telemarketing/data). It is related to direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution, conducted through phone calls. Often, multiple contacts with the same client were required to determine if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed to (`yes`) or not (`no`).

### Files
